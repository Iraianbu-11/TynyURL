          <AccordionContent>
          Our URL shortener takes long, complicated URLs and compresses them into short, user-friendly links. Simply paste your long link into the box, hit â€˜Shorten,â€™ and instantly get a compact version. Use the short link in social media, emails, or wherever you need quick access. Plus, every click on your shortened URL is tracked, so you can monitor the performance of your shared content.

          <AccordionTrigger>Why Should I Use a URL Shortener?</AccordionTrigger>
          <AccordionContent>
          Long URLs can look messy, are difficult to remember, and sometimes break when shared in emails or social media. A URL shortener makes sharing your links more efficient. It improves user experience, boosts engagement, and ensures compatibility across platforms. Whether you're managing marketing campaigns or just simplifying personal links, a short URL keeps things clean and professional.
